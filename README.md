## Week 1:

The first week of the CSS focuses on an introduction to the Python programming language through data science principles with radio astronomy focus. This allow students new to Python an easier transition since we start with performing simple tasks using Excel spreadsheets to doing the same and more tasks in Python.

## Python:

- What is Python
- How to install and run Python Code
- Excel to Python
- Basic usage
- Scripts & Variables
- Data Storage
- Text & Strings
- ETL - Extract Transform Load
- EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis
- Astronomy applications

## Linux/Bash:

- What is Linux and Bash
- Running a Bash Terminal
-File Management

## Teachers:

Mr Binjamin ("Binyamin") Barsch
Mr Sean February
Mr Mthetho Sovara
Dr Kevin Colville 

In-person lessons and tutorials will be held to put the material into practice. The School is structured in such a way to encourage students to actively solve challenging problems that the lectures will pose. Students should be prepared to learn on their own!

## School Structure

- Daily lectures and interactive tutorials
- Notes, quizzes, and assignments provided
- Practice all the code examples in the notes
- Code out the quiz questions to work out the answer
- Go through all content and mark the page as done
- Zoom used for live streaming
- Zoom recordings of the live lessons will be provided at the end of the day
- The content will be made available the previous day
- Slack used as official communication medium
- Github used as code repository

## Key Times

- Class Starts: 10:30

- Morning Tea/Break: 11:00 - 11:30

## Course Preparation

Make sure the following is done:

1. make sure you have [Python Software Setup](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/9909724/modules/items/113086649) and [Linux Software Setup](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/9909724/modules/items/113086650) (only for Windows machines) ready and setup

2. you have created a [Create a Github Account](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/9909724/modules/items/113086651) if you don't have one already

Lastly...

For general inquiries any questions related to the course or content, only use Slack - emails will not be responded to once the course has started.
